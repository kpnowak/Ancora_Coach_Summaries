The video was recorded between Krzysztof Piotr Nowak (coach) and Stanis≈Çaw Wasilewski (client) to imitate the conversation between coach and client.

Then open Summaries.pl file and adjust the OpenAI API key in the code.

Then, run the Summaries.pl python code to get the final summary. Be carefule, because you will have to install lot of libraries.
